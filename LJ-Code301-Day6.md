This weekends code was a tough one. Although the forms and grabbing value from it was not a hard task, it was rendering a preview that caused the most issue. I think the issues we all experienced was a factor of many things. But mostly I feel like the outlay of 301 is super disjointed.

I think I understand the high level concept of AJAX calls with JSON. The idea that people have aggregated so much data together is awesome and I'm looking forward to utilizing it.

I feel pretty out of my element here. I feel like I can do things but I don't really grasp it.

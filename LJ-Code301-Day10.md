This week felt more heavy than our first week. We covered a lot more ground than I thought we could cover. Let's recap. AJAX, intro to node, intro to express, intro to postgres. Sounds like we just did a crash course on being a full stack developer.

One of my concerns is that I have is that since we're looking at code and trying to troubleshoot, I'm not having enough hands on time writing code. It's a weird feeling. Right now, I feel like my conceptual and theoretical knowledge is increasing, but my code writing abilities pretty static.

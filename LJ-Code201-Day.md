Today I learned:

I was able to learn mostly about while and for loops. Though I don't think I grasped the subject too well. I think a lot of people had issues with it. I also think I learned to get better grasp on github and git. I might need to practice quite a bit but I have the general idea down.

Box modeling seems mostly straight forward but I don't think I'll actually know until I'm able to mess around with it myself. That's all that comes to mind. Today was a long day!

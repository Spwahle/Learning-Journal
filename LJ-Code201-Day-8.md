Today seemed to mostly be about Forms and the ability for us to pull information from them to store information elsewhere. I felt that this lesson when working with the DOM was a bit confusing but I mostly got a grasp on it.

The lab itself was actually relatively easy. I did need a bit help from a fellow student. However; building a form itself seems very simple and straightforward. The difficulty came when I was expected to pull the information into the chart.

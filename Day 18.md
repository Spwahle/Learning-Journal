Ultimately, this group project was a fantastic learning experience. I gained invaluable experience working
with a number of other classmates, having to trust each other, having to communicate, and having to compromise
on what would be built. And the final result, a fully-functioning, practical app made in less than three days,
inspires me to think of bigger and bolder apps.

<h2>Day 1</h2>

Today was orientation day for 301. I'm not going to lie. I'm pretty excited. I think 201 was a good place to start because it gave me an idea of how to organize for the material we are going to learn. I kind of hate that I took a month off. I did do a lot of self study but I'm not sure I'm quite ready.

I'm kind of nervous about pair programming. I'm just not used to programming with someone else. I think my first partner is a great guy though!

Today we had our first lecture. 11-12 and then 1-4. Talk about a lot to digest. The before lunch was mostly Bandi talking about code of conduct and the mission statement for Codefellows. It's a rehash but it's important.

After lunch we were able to go over mobile first/responsive web design. It's a great approach and honestly not all that hard. I'm really just excited to utilize jQuery and other parts.

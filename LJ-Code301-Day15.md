LASY LECTURE OF 301

I'm not sure I really paid attention much because I was so excited about projects. I've been grouped with Gavin, Kimmer
and Isaac. I think we have a good mix of talents here! We wanted to do a hardware project but I was shot down by Scott.
Which is a bit of a relief because even though I know it's relatively easy.......it's my first time fiddling with hardware.

We ended up going with a netflix movie picker. We had a lot of logic problems to figure out! How will we filter with which APIs
to use! But I think Gavin and I were able to really work through some problems. I'm coordinating the project. Gavin will be
the majority of JS I beleive. Kimmer will be design and seems like he'd be a good presenter. Isaac is incharge of local storage and database. Looking forward to working with them!

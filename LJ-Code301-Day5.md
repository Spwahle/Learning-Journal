Learning Journal 5

Today Scott was sick so we had a combined class with Stephanie teaching.
She worked through make a form and having a preview displayed before hand.
Although I do understand forms, how to style them and how to have them populate
via the DOM. However, I'm a little lost when we try to make a preview displayed.

The instruction on the lab were a little unclear I think. So I ended up doing it on my own.

Today seemed to mostly be about Forms and the ability for us to pull information from them to store information elsewhere. I felt that this lesson when working with the DOM was a bit confusing but I mostly got a grasp on it.

The lab itself was actually relatively easy. I did need a bit help from a fellow student. However; building a form itself seems very simple and straightforward. The difficulty came when I was expected to pull the information into the chart.

Forms are an important part of theInternet, as they provide a way for websites to capture information from users and to process requests, and they offer controls so many things. Seems like the one of the most interactive ways for users to use a website in our skill set at the moment

Day 13 - Local Storage

Today we had a chance to mess around with local storage. Granted at first I really wasn't following. However, towards the end of the lecture I'm not sure why but I totally grasped the concept.

I also didn't have too much of an issue adding it into my code. I was even able to rewrite and make my code more concise!

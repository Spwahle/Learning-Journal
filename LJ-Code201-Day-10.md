Day 10 - Review of DOM and Objects

We went over a review which I found to be very helpful. First we reviewed Object literals which is a way to build an item with attributes and save it to memory. It's defined and given attributes with the : assignment. We branched off that by talking about the constructor function. I felt I already have a pretty firm grasp on this!

We also went over the DOM which to me is manipulation of HTML elements via Javascript. This is done through dot notation and calling or inserting elements.

We also went over building a wireframe which although I'm not sure I will be able to replicate. It will be useful to reference in the future.

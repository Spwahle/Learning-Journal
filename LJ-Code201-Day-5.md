Day Five Learning Journal

Day 5 consisted of covering some cool tricks and better understanding CSS elements. We learned how to code a basic website with logo's a navigation box and pictures. We also worked on a few functions and how to better understand them. I understand the need for functions and how they can be used to call earlier code up.

The lab work was challenging, but we had so much collaborative between all the students it was really great!

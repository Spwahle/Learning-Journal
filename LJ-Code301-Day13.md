<h1>Heroku Deployment<h1>

Heroku deployment was extremely easy to understand and implement in the lab. I did have a bit of a brain fart when it came to the file path of the repos. However, we were able to finish in less than an hour.

Heroku really seems to make it extremely easy to deploy. I even think their GUI makes more sense than doing it in console. The webcycle that Scott went through kind of went over my head. I'll need to rewatch lecture and maybe look up some youtube videos.
